DO's :

->iw dev 

->use this command to run the"gui.py" ( sudo /home/<user name>/Documents/WiScan/.venv/bin/python /home/<user name>/Documents/WiScan/gui.py)

->Do run the program with appropriate permissions (e.g., sudo) because packet sniffing requires elevated privileges.

->Do specify the correct wireless interface (e.g., wlp4s0) based on your system’s configuration.

->Do keep your software and dependencies (like Scapy) updated to ensure compatibility and security.

->Do test the system in a controlled environment to avoid false alarms and unintended interference.

->Do monitor logs and reports regularly to detect any suspicious wireless activity early.

->Do handle user input and threading carefully in the GUI to prevent crashes.

->Do consider enhancing detection rules and signatures over time for better accuracy.

->Do ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations when capturing network packets.

DONT'S


->Don’t run the tool on networks without proper authorization — it may be illegal.

->Don’t ignore error messages related to missing interfaces or permissions.

->Don’t flood the network or perform active attacks during testing; this project is for detection only.

->Don’t expose sensitive captured data without encryption or access controls.

->Don’t leave the tool running unattended on untrusted networks.

->Don’t neglect updating the database of known devices or MAC addresses to reduce false positives.

->Don’t rely solely on this tool for complete network security; use it as part of a broader security strategy.
